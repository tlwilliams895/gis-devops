Certificate Authority
=====================

In this walkthrough, we will be looking at how a servers use certificates to validate their identity.

Spring Security
===============

For this walkthrough, we will be using `Spring Security <https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.8.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/>`_ to secure our application.  Spring Security will enable us to use username/password, client certificates, and attach a certificate to our server.

Setup
=====

1. Check out the `Server Certificate Repo <https://gitlab.com/LaunchCodeTraining/x509-certificate-starter>`_ from Gitlab
2. Review the starter code

   1. ``UserController`` that checks the certificate of the user
   2.  A properties file that defines the ``jks``, the ``truststore``, and other configuration for SSL.
   3.  A Makefile in ``src/main/resources/certs`` that contains commands to simplify the process of creating certificates.

Simple Security With Spring
===========================

1. In your browser go to http://localhost:8080/user
2. You should see a login prompt

   * This prompt is created by the browser as part of `Basic Access Authentication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_

3. `Basic Access Authentication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_ is enabled because Spring Security is included in the ``gradle`` file

Set and Use Username/Password
-----------------------------
1. Create a **Run Configuration** that will run the ``bootRun`` task
2. In **Run Configuration**, add the below **Environment Variables** and values

   * ``APP-USERNAME`` = adminUser
   * ``APP-PASSWORD`` = changeit
   * For now ignore the other commented out values in ``application.properties``

3. Run ``bootRun`` task via **Run Configuration** menu
4. Go to http://localhost:8080/user
5. Enter the username/password you have stored in **Run Configuration**

HTTPS Certificates with Spring Security
=======================================
`Basic Access Authentication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_ is not secure by itself, it should be used with HTTPS. We want to add HTTPS to our web application using Spring Security.

Enable HTTPS in Applicaiton Properties
--------------------------------------
There are specific properties in ``application.properties`` that configure Spring Security and Tomcat server settings. `More information on Spring Security Users <https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-security.html>`_

These are the properties that enable HTTPS (SSL)::

    server.ssl.key-store=src/main/resources/certs/keystore.jks
    server.ssl.key-store-password=${CERT-PASSWORD}
    server.ssl.key-alias=localhost
    server.ssl.key-password=${CERT-PASSWORD}
    server.ssl.enabled=true
    server.port=8443

.. note::

   Port 8443 is the alternate SSL port. The default SSL port is 443

.. warning::

    If you run ``bootRun`` before creating certs for HTTPS, you will see this error: ``The Tomcat connector configured to listen on port 8443 failed to start. The port may already be in use or the connector may be misconfigured.``

Configure Intellij Run Configurations
-------------------------------------
1. Add ``CERT-PASSWORD`` and it's value to **Environment Variables** in **Run Configurations**

   * ``CERT-PASSWORD`` = The password you used to create keystore and certificate in previous section
   * You will use this password value for all ``PASSWORD=`` commands below

Create HTTPS Certificate
------------------------

After checking out the example project, you will need to generate the cryptographic components required for Spring Boot to host a certificate.

A ``jks`` also known as a ``Java Key Store`` will need to be generated.  Since we will be using a self-signed certificate, this ``jks`` file will act as our local Certificate Authority.  Run the following command (be sure to use a secure password!):

Create Keystore (keystork.jks)
------------------------------
::

    $ make create-keystore PASSWORD=changeit
    $ # Generate a certificate authority (CA)
    keytool -genkey -alias ca -ext BC=ca:true \
            -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA512withRSA -keypass changeit \
            -validity 3650 -dname 'CN=LaunchCode CA,OU=launchcode.org,O=LaunchCode,L=Saint Louis,ST=Missouri,C=CC' \
            -keystore keystore.jks -storepass changeit


By doing an ``ls``, you should now see that you ``keystore.jks`` file in your directory.

Create Certificate (localhost.crt)
----------------------------------
Next you will create a certificate for you local development environment. Run the following command:::

    $ make add-host HOSTNAME=localhost PASSWORD=changeit

Running ``ls`` will show that there are now two additional files in your director: ``localhost.csr`` and ``localhost.cst``.

Create Truststore (ca.crt)
--------------------------
Next, you will need to create a ``truststore``.  The ``truststore`` is where all trusted certificates are located.  It is essentially the ``known_hosts`` for certificates.

::

    $ make create-truststore PASSWORD=changeit
    # Export certificate authority
    keytool -export -alias ca -file ca.crt -rfc \
            -keystore keystore.jks -storepass changeit
    Certificate stored in file <ca.crt>
    # Import certificate authority into a new truststore
    keytool -import -trustcacerts -noprompt -alias ca -file ca.crt \
            -keystore truststore.jks -storepass changeit
    Certificate was added to keystore


Running ``ls`` will show that two more files have been added to your directory: ``ca.crt`` and ``truststore.jks``.

Connection is Not Secure
------------------------
Let's try out our app and see what happens.

1. Uncomment all properties in ``application.properties``
2. Set all values in **Run Configurations**
3. Run or ReRun ``bootRun`` task
4. Go to ``https://localhost:8443/`` in your browser
5. You should see this or something like it depending on your browser

.. image:: /_static/images/insecure-connection.png

Add Certificate Authority to the Browser (ca.crt)
-------------------------------------------------

Upon running the app, navigate to https://localhost:8443.  Notice that the app is now running on ``https``.  This says that all traffic going over the write is encrypted.  The only question is "Do you trust the person that you are talking to?".

The first thing you will notice is that your browser doesn't recognize the certificate from the server. Anytime there is a bad certificate on a server, your browser will freak out.  Let's fix that.

Add ``ca.crt`` as a CA to your browser


Client Certificates
===================

Spring Security can be configured to authenticate users using client certificates.

Enable Certificate Authentication in Spring Security
----------------------------------------------------
Add these properties to ``application.properties`` to enable client authentication user certificates::

    server.ssl.trust-store=src/main/resources/certs/truststore.jks
    server.ssl.trust-store-password=${CERT-PASSWORD}
    server.ssl.client-auth=need

Create and Add Client Certificate to Keystore (janet.crt)
---------------------------------------------------------
Next, you will create a client certificate and add it to the truststore.

::

    $ make add-client CLIENTNAME=janet PASSWORD=changeit
    //output
    keytool -genkey -alias janet \
            -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA512withRSA -keypass changeit \
            -validity 3650 -dname 'CN=janet,OU=launchcode.com,O=LaunchCode,L=Saint Louis,ST=Missouri,C=CC' \
            -keystore truststore.jks -storepass changeit
    # Generate a host certificate signing request
    keytool -certreq -alias janet -ext BC=ca:true \
            -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA512withRSA \
            -validity 3650 -file "janet.csr" \
            -keystore truststore.jks -storepass changeit
    # Generate signed certificate with the certificate authority
    keytool -gencert -alias ca \
            -validity 3650 -sigalg SHA512withRSA \
            -infile "janet.csr" -outfile "janet.crt" -rfc \
            -keystore keystore.jks -storepass changeit
    # Import signed certificate into the truststore
    keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias janet \
            -file "janet.crt" \
            -keystore truststore.jks -storepass changeit
    Certificate reply was installed in keystore
    # Export private certificate for importing into a browser
    keytool -importkeystore -srcalias janet \
            -srckeystore truststore.jks -srcstorepass changeit \
            -destkeystore "janet.p12" -deststorepass changeit \
            -deststoretype PKCS12

Add Client Certificate to the Browser
-------------------------------------
Your browser needs to be configured to use a certificate to authenticate you when visiting certain sites.

TODO: instructions and images


Summary of Client Authentication
--------------------------------
A lot just happened, let's review.

* First, it needs to create a key for your user. A key is created and placed in the ``keystore.jks``.

* Second, a signing requrest ``.csr`` file was generated based on the key.  This is what is used to aske the Certificate Authority to sign your certificate.

* Third, the signing requrest ``.csr`` is passed to the Certificate Authority and a signed certificate is passed back as the ``janet.crt``.

* Fourth, the ``janet.crt`` file is stored in the ``truststore.jks``.

* Fifth and finally, the ``janet.crt`` file needs to be exported so that it can be included in the browser.  The result is a ``janet.p12`` file that can be given to the user and used to authenticate against an X509 server.
