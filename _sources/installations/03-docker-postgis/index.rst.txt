============================
Installation: Docker PostGIS
============================

Installation Steps: Mac
-----------------------

1. Create an env.list file
2. Shutdown any other PSQL containers
3. Create container
4. Connect to psql

Create env.list
+++++++++++++++

Before we create our container we first need to create a temporary file that will create our containers first user, and configure the container to listen for requests.

* Create a new file in your terminal ``$ nano env.list``
* Add ``POSTGRES_USER=psql_user`` to env.list
* Add ``POSTGRES_PASS=psqlpass`` to env.list
* Add ``ALLOW_IP_RANGE=<0.0.0.0/0>`` to env.list
* Save env.list

This small file will have postgres create a new user named psql_user, and allow all IP addresses to make requests to the container.

Shutdown Other PSQL containers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before we create and run our new container, let's make sure we don't have any other running PSQL containers.

* From your terminal run ``$ docker ps -a``
* If you have any running containers shut them down with ``$ docker stop [CONTAINER_NAME/ID]``

Create Container
++++++++++++++++

We can now create, and run our container with ``$ docker run --name "postgis" -p 5432:5432 -d -t --env-file ./env.list kartoza/postgis:9.4-2.1``

* ``docker run`` runs a command in a container (in this case it creates the container since it doesn't already exist)
* ``--name`` allows us to name our container (in this case we are naming our container "postgis")
* ``-p`` allows us to *publish* a port (host_port:container_port in this case both are the psql default 5432)
* ``-d`` starts our container in *detach* mode which means it will run in the background
* ``-t`` allows us to run a terminal command (in this case adding the contents of our env.list file)
* ``--env-file ./env.list`` the type of file, and the file from our computerres
* ``kartoza/postgis:9.4-2.1`` the image of the container (in this case postgres version 9.4, with the postgis extension version 2.1)

This command creates a container named "postgis" with the postgres:9.4 image, with postgis:2.1 that listens on port 5432, is detached from this command, and we are running a command to add the contents of env.list to our new "postgis" container.

If you run ``$ docker ps -a`` now you should see a new container named "postgres".

Connect to psql
+++++++++++++++

Now we will want to connect to postgres to make sure it installed correctly. To do this you will need the psql interactive terminal installed on your computer. This comes with every installation of Postgres. You can check that you have this by typing ``$ postgres --version`` to verify postgres is installed on your computer.

If it isn't installed you will want to check out :ref:`Postgres Installation <postgres>` to install Postgres.

Once you have Postgres installed on your local computer, and you have created the new "postgres" container we can connect to our "postgres" container by typing ``$ psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U psql_user -d postgres`` into our terminal. This command will drop you into psql.

* ``psql`` The command to access the PSQL Interactive Terminal
* ``-h 127.0.0.1`` The ip address of the host we are connecting to (in this case it's localhost)
* ``-p 5432`` The port of the machine we are accessing (in this case the psql default)
* ``-U psql_user`` The user that is requesting access to the database (in this case the user we added with the env.list file)
* ``-d postgres`` The name of the database we want to access (in this case the default database created by postgres)
