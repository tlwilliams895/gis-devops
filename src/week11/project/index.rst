Week 11 - Project Week: Zika Mission Control Part 4
===================================================

Overview
========

`Read Mission Briefing 4 <../../_static/images/zika_mission_briefing_4.pdf>`_


You will be adding GeoServer to your local and deployed application. This will require several steps, including setting up a GeoServer instance, connecting it to a PostGIS store, and creating a new layer from existing data.

After you have this new system fully set up, you'll be able to add additional layers in GeoServer and show them using OpenLayers.

Requirements
============

1. Use GeoServer to display the report features.
2. Incorporate additional layers using external data (e.g. elevation, temperature, natural earth).
3. Deploy your application to AWS, including a EC2 instance running GeoServer.

Normalizing Data
================

Before we get to integrating GeoServer, we need to do a fair amount of prep work.

The first change we want to make has to do with normalizing the report data. In the data set that we have been using up to this point, each row of the ``report`` table has the location stored as a string. This means that locations are repeated for each report in a given location. For example, the value ``United_States-Puerto_Rico`` shows up in the ``location`` column of 1216 reports. Rather than have this value repeated, it would be better for each such report to have a foreign key reference to a single location.

We want to set up the Java code to "normalize" the report and location data. This means that locations and reports will be stored in separate tables, and each report will have a foreign key to the location that it belongs to.

To accomplish this, we will create a relationship between ``Report`` and ``Location`` via a new field, ``Report.state``. This will be a many-to-one relationship configured via Hibernate.

In ``ReportRepository``, add the following new method:

.. code-block:: java

   public List<Report> findByLocationStartingWithIgnoreCase(String location);

Next, create a ``ReportController`` class with the following contents:

.. code-block:: java

  /*
  * In src/main/java/com/launchcode/gisdevops/
  */
  @Controller
  @RequestMapping(value = "/api/report")
  public class ReportController {


      @Autowired
      private ReportRepository reportRepository;

      @Autowired
      private LocationRepository locationRepository;

      @Autowired
      private ReportDocumentRepository reportDocumentRepository;

      @PostMapping(value = "/assignStates")
      public ResponseEntity<String> assignStates() {

          List<Location> locations = locationRepository.findAll();

          for (Location location : locations) {
              String countryPart = location.getCountryNormalized().replace(" ", "_");
              String statePart = location.getStateNormalized().replace(" ", "_");
              List<Report> matchingReports = reportRepository.findByLocationStartingWithIgnoreCase(countryPart + "-" + statePart);
              for (Report report : matchingReports) {
                  report.setState(location);
              }
              reportRepository.saveAll(matchingReports);
          }

          return new ResponseEntity<>("Complete", HttpStatus.OK);
      }

  }

Take a minute to review these methods. The ``assignStates`` method will loop over all reports, looking for an appropriate ``Location`` object for each and saving it in the ``state`` field of ``Report``. (We haven't created this field yet, so you'll see a red compiler error.)

Let's now create the relationship between reports and locations.

In ``Report``, add the following field:

.. code-block:: java

   @ManyToOne
   private Location state;

Add a getter and setter for this field as well.

In ``Location``, add the other side of the relationship:

.. code-block:: java

   @OneToMany
   @JoinColumn(name = "state_id")
   private List<Report> reports = new ArrayList<>();

Add a getter and setter for this field too.

Setup
=====

Now let's move closer to integrating GeoServer. We need to do a few setup tasks first. 

Change VirtualBox Port Mapping
------------------------------

Our GeoServer virtual machine has some port mappings set up that allow the "host" (our macOS) and the "guest" (the virtual Linux machine running GeoServer) to communicate. One of these will conflict with our local Postgres server.

From VirtualBox, right-click on your GeoServer VM and select *Settings*. Choose the *Network* tab, then *Adapter 1*. Expande the *Advanced* section and click the *Port Forwarding* button. Change the *Host Port* value for the **postgres** entry from ``5432`` to ``5433``.

Change Tomcat Port
------------------

Tomcat is the Java application server that Spring Boot runs within. Its default port is 8080.

Before we can run our Spring app, we need to configure Tomcat to run on a port other than 8080. Recall that we set up the GeoServer container to bind to port 8080 on our localhost. We can easily adjust the port that Tomcat/Spring Boot will run on by adding ``server.port=9090`` to ``application.properties``.

.. note::

  You may also need to change the port referenced in ``script.js``. ``url: 'http://localhost:9090/api/es/report/?date=2016-03-05'``. Another solution for this is to use a relative path ``url: '/api/es/report/?date=2016-03-05'``

Start up your Spring app. Verify that the app started up cleanly.

.. warning:: From now on, your Spring Boot app will be hosted at ``localhost:9090``. Be sure to use the new port when viewing your app! 

Add foreign keys to reports
---------------------------

We want to set up explicit relationships between reports and locations in the database. To do this, we've created an endpoint to help us. Calling this endpoint will result in a ``Location`` object being found for each ``Report`` object, and being attached to the report via the ``state`` field. This creates a reference/foreign key relationship.

Start up your Spring app and hit the endpoint from the command line: ::

  $ curl -XPOST http://localhost:9090/api/report/assignStates


This will take a few minutes to run. When the request is complete, all ``Report`` objects for which there is a corresponding ``Location`` will have the relationship stored as a foreign key in the ``report.state_id`` column.

Database and Layer Setup
------------------------

Normalizing our application data in PostGIS is good for our Java app, but we need to do a bit of additional work to get data in the data in a format that makes it easily usable by GeoServer.

In particular, we will create some views that pull in data from different tables that we want to be available as features. These views will allow us to create a layer in GeoServer that will allow us to query location geometries with case totals by date.

Using either ``psql`` or a Postgres graphical client to connect to your PostGIS database. Create two views:

.. code-block:: sql

  CREATE view cases_by_state_and_date AS
    SELECT state_id,report_date,sum(value) AS cases FROM report
    GROUP BY state_id,report_date;


.. code-block:: sql

  CREATE view states_with_cases_by_date AS
    SELECT * FROM location INNER JOIN cases_by_state_and_date ON location.id=cases_by_state_and_date.state_id;

Integrating GeoServer
=====================

Create Data Store and Layers in GeoServer
-----------------------------------------

For this step, we'll need to know the IP address of our host system (macOS) as seen by the GeoServer VM. To find this, first SSH into the VM: ::

  ssh -p 2020 root@localhost

Recall that the password for the root account on the server is **boundless123**.

One you have a shell within the VM, run ``netstat -rn``. You will see something like this:

.. image:: /_static/images/netstat-rn.png

Look for the row with ``0.0.0.0`` in the Destination column. The Gateway value of that row (in this case, ``10.0.2.2``) is the IP address that you would use to communicate with the host machine from within the virtual machine. Make a note of the IP. We'll use it shortly.

* Create a workspace in GeoServer (we recommend ``lc/https://launchcode.org``)
* Create a PostGIS data store

  * Use ``zika`` as the database name and the host IP that you looked up a few minutes ago (``10.0.2.2`` in our example) as the hostname

* Create a new layer from the ``states_with_cases_by_date`` table

  * Make sure Native and Declared SRS are set to **EPSG:4326**
  * For Native Bounding Box, click on **Compute from data**
  * For Lat/Lon Bounding Box, click on **Compute from native bounds**

Updating OpenLayers Code
------------------------

Following the `OpenLayers example <https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/vector-wfs-getfeature.html>`_ for querying ``GetFeature``, update your OpenLayers code to query GeoServer to get locations with report totals by date. You'll need to use the ``ol.format.filter.equalTo`` filter.

.. warning::

  For the geometries in your layer to be rendered properly on the map, the spatial reference systems (SRS) must match. You can control the SRS that is used to generate the returned features using the ``srsName`` parameter when create the request in OpenLayers.

Bonus Mission
-------------

When you complete all of these instructions, check out the `ElasticGeo Plugin <https://github.com/ngageoint/elasticgeo>`_. It is an Elasticsearch plugin that allows you to integrate Elasticsearch into GeoServer. The great thing is that you can do Elasticsearch queries directly through GeoServer via WFS calls. Here are the setup instructions and instructions on how to make the calls: `ElasticGeo Instructions <https://github.com/ngageoint/elasticgeo/blob/master/gs-web-elasticsearch/doc/index.rst>`_
