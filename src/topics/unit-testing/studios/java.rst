======================
Refactoring With JUnit
======================

For this studio, you will be writing unit tests to help you find errors in provided code.

Getting Started
---------------

* Fork, and clone the `Studio Repository <https://gitlab.com/LaunchCodeTraining/junit-studio>`_
* Create a story branch for your work
* Write unit tests for the 4 provided classes (BalancedBrackets, BinarySearch, RomanNumeral, and Fraction)
* Find and fix all 5 errors in the provided classes

Discuss with your fellow students, and the instructor how each of these classes should behave. What are some examples of input, and what would the desired output be for each input?

Uploading Your Work
-------------------

After fixing the issues make sure to upload your work, by staging, committing, and pushing your work to your GitLab repository. After pushing your work let the instructor know.
