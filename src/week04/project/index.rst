===================================================
Week 4 - Project Week: Zika Mission Control Part 2
===================================================

Project Requirements
====================

Following are the requirements from our stakeholders, and our tech team.

Stakeholder Requirements
------------------------

- Users can add report data through the web app.
- Users can search for keywords in all reports. Searches that include typos still yield results.
- Users can view reports over time.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

- Data changes: The underlying CSVs that drive our web app have changed. The database will need to be altered to accomidate this different data.
- Rest: Users READ, and ADD report data via a Rest Controller.
- Rest Documentation: Swagger/Springfox used to create Rest API Endpoint documentation.
- Datastore: Elasticsearch needs to be used as the secondary data store for report data. Elasticsearch fuzzy search should be implemented to allow for flexible keyword searching.

Primary Objectives
==================

You should **complete all primary objectives** before working on any secondary objectives.

For your primary objectives articles have been provided to help you think about what needs to be completed to pass the objective.

0. Refactor to allow for new data!
1. Dispaly report data via a hard-coded date
2. Display report data via a user defined date
3. Fuzzy search for report keywords

Secondary Objectives
====================

- Refactor so all report data is served from elasticsearch
- Add new locations by learning how the data from the location.csv file was sourced, and created
- Refactor so ReSTful Endpoints are used any time data is touched
- Increase test coverage


0. `Create a Spring application <../spring-application/>`_, setup Git, and GitLab, configure the DB, and prepare IntelliJ.
1. `Display an interactive map <../display-map/>`_ from OSM in the browser.
2. `Display Zika reports <../display-reports/>`_ on the map as red circles.
3. `Clicked Zika reports <../clickable-reports>`_ display more information about the report.

Secondary Objectives
====================

For your secondary objectives no guidance will be given to you. You will have to think about what needs to be completed to pass the objective.

- Zika reports change color based on the sevirity of the outbreak.
- Zika reports change size based on the sevirity of the outbreak.
- Duplicate city/state/country names are not displayed if more than one report is selected.
- Sensitive Database information has not been committed to our version control software.
- Database is secure from SQL injection.
- Add coordinate information to CSV files that are missing latitude, and longitude.

Turning in Your Work
====================

Code Review
-----------

Let your instructor know When you complete the primary objectives. The instructor will need a link to your GitLab repo, and they will peform a code review, and leave you feedback.

Objective Checklist
-------------------

As you work through the objectives for this week, keep track of them on your Checklist, your instructor will also confirm which objectives you completed in their code review. If you don't pass an objective the instructor will give you feedback on what you need to do to complete that objective.

Presentation
------------

Friday afternoon, everyone will present their project to the class. This presentation is meant to be a celebration of your hard work throughout the week, and as a chance for you to share, and learn from the other students in the class.

At the end of this course, during your graduation ceremony you will be expected to present your final project to the attendees. Every project week we will have a presentation as a way for you to practice for this final presentation.

Check Your Knowledge
====================

We covered a lot of ground this week. 

To reinforce your understanding of the concepts answer these questions to yourself:
    - When did we have to make changes to a controller file?
    - When did we have to make changes to a repository file?
    - When did we have to make changes to the index.html file?
    - When did we have to make changes to the script.js file?
    - When did we have to make changes to our test files?
    - How does our application communicate with the database?
    - Our data starts as various CSV files. How is that data transformed throughout our project?
    - How does our application convert a Java Object to GeoJSON?
    - How do we create a new layer in OpenLayers?
    - How do we add that layer to our map from OSM?









Project
=======

 `Mission Briefing 2 <../../_static/images/zika_mission_briefing_2.pdf>`_

Overview
========

Your goal is to extend the CDC Zika Dashboard that you built last week. The scientists need several new features for the dashboard. Here are the stories:

1. CDC scientists have the ability to add new reports to the database.
2. CDC scientists have the  ability to visualize how the infection rate of each area changes over time.
3. CDC scientists have the ability to perform fuzzy search across all of the data.

.. note::

  Remember, in Agile a story is just a "guaranteed conversation". Stories usually don't contain all of the details necessary to complete the task and that's why it is important to follow up with the client and talk through the exact needs of your customer.

Getting the code
================
1. Create a story branch named ``week4-solution`` from your solution to the week 2 zika project
2. Make sure you have a remote in your repo that points to https://gitlab.com/LaunchCodeTraining/zika-cdc-dashboard
3. Run ``git fetch upstream`` (Assuming upstream points to the above repo)
4. Run ``git checkout -b week4-starter upstream/week4-starter``
5. Run ``git checkout week4-soltuion``
6. Now you can get the new files by pulling them in. Run ``git merge week4-starter`` OR by simply pasting in select files. The choice is up to you.

.. note::

  If you decide to back out of a merge and try something else you can always reset your branch to it's previous state.
  The below command destroys all non committed changes in your local branch and reverts back to the previous commit. ``$ git reset --hard``

What's new in the code
======================

* CSV files ``data/locations.csv`` and ``data/all_reports.csv``
* ``src/main/resources/import.sql`` copies the csv data into PostGIS when SpringBoot starts up (as long as `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` is `create` or `create-drop` in `application.properties`)
* Location data now contains multi-polygons instead of a single point
* Elasticsearch dependencies and Repositories have been added
* ``ESController`` contains an endpoint to populate Elasticsearch with all data in your PostGIS db

Requirements
============

Use TDD when implementing these requirements

1. Build out a ``/api/report`` endpoint that accepts a POST containing Report JSON in the body.

   * Store the Report created from JSON in PostGIS
   * Store the ReportDocument created from JSON in Elasticsearch

2. Show Zika report data for a certain date on a map via OpenLayers (reports grouped by state for a certain date)
3. When a feature is clicked show the related report data (like in week 2 zika project)
4. Ability to change the data displayed by changing the report date
5. Search input and search button that uses Elasticsearch fuzzy search

   * When search is executed matching reports should be shown below map
   * And/Or Features present on map should change to be only those that match report date and fuzzy search term

6. Make sure you application is secure from `SQL injection attacks <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection>`_ by validating the query parameters.
7. Create API docs with Springfox.
8. Use Eslint and Airbnb ruleset to make sure your JS meets team standards.

Suggested Endpoints/Parameters
==============================

1. ``api/report?date=2016-05-14`` should return GeoJSON created from reports filtered by report date

   * Most likey you want this data to come from Elasticsearch because of requirement #2

2. ``api/report?search=brzil`` should return GeoJSON created from Elasticsearch filtered using fuzzy search
3. ``api/report?search=brzil&date=2016-05-14`` should use both the ``date`` and ``search`` query parameters to limit the results.
4. ``api/report/unique-dates`` returns JSON containing all unique report dates

.. note::

    To index all of the reports in PostGIS into Elasticsearch use the following command: ``$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/api/_cluster/reindex``

Database Setup
==============

Install the following extension on your PostGIS databases (don't forget to do the same in your test db):::

  # CREATE EXTENSION unaccent;

Walkthrough on Creating the Location Data
=========================================

All the spatial data you need is already included in the starter branch. However before starting to code this project please go through this walkthrough to see how it was created.  This will provide some insight into creating and configuring spatial data such as country and state boundaries.

Adding Boundary Geometries
--------------------------

The data that the scientists want to ingest is summarized in the `CDC Zika Repository <https://github.com/cdcepi/zika>`_. If you open up the `data for Argentina <https://github.com/cdcepi/zika/blob/master/Argentina/Surveillance_Bulletin/data/Surveillance_Bulletin_01_2017-01-12.csv>`_, you'll notice that the data looks pretty similiar to last mission, except that there is no latitude or longitude to geocode each row; however, each row does have a location field. We should be able to indentify those locations to actual areas on a map.

Search for "political boundaries geojson" and find `gadm.org <http://www.gadm.org/>`_. This site provides geospatial data about administrative boundaries for each state. Go to the `GADM Downloads Page <http://www.gadm.org/country>`_ to check out the data.

.. image:: /_static/images/GADM_download_page.png

Download the `shapefile for Brazil <http://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/gadm2.8/shp/BRA_adm_shp.zip>`_.

The file ``BRA_adm_shp.zip`` will download. Double click the file to unzip the file. You should see three shapefiles: ``BRA_adm0.shp``, ``BRA_adm1.shp``, ``BRA_adm2.shp``. ``BRA_adm3.shp``. Let's take a look at these shapefiles. In order to look at a shapefile, you will need download `QGIS <https://qgis.org/en/site/>`_, an open source desktop viewer for geospatial data. QGIS can be downloaded via the `Boundless site <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/Downloads>`_. After downloading, double click the ``.dmg`` file to install.

.. note::

  Note: Use your personal email to register on Boundless Connect to get access to the QGIS download.

After QGIS is installed, drag the ``BRA_adm1.shp`` file into the QGIS window in order to import the file.

.. note::

  The zoom on the QGIS window is VERY sensitive. You may need to automatically zoom to the layer you would like to view. Right click on your layer in the *Layers Panel*, and select *Zoom to Layer*.

.. image:: /_static/images/QGIS_zoom_to_layer.png

Great! That looks exactly like what we need. Let's convert the file into GeoJSON so that we can serve it up from within our web application. We can use the ``ogr2ogr`` command. ::

  $ ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" brazil.geojson BRA_adm_shp/BRA_adm1.shp

After the command completes, check out the ``brazil.geojson`` file. Yikes! The file seems pretty big. Let's see how big: ::

  $ ls -lh brazil.geojson

.. image:: /_static/images/CLI_check_file_size.png

A 25M file is not going to work well in our web app. And that's just Brazil!

Fortunately, shapefiles can be compressed in size by reducing the amount of detail. In QGIS, select *Vector > Geometry Tools > Simplify geometries* from the top menu. Select your Brazil Geometry ``BRA_adm1`` and set the tolerance to ``0.05``. Hit Run.

.. image:: /_static/images/QGIS_simplify_geometries.png

QGIS should generate a new layer that looks pretty much the same as the last layer.

Right click on the newly created layer and select *Save As...*. Save the file as GeoJSON with the name ``brazil_compressed.geojson``. Be sure to type in the entire path of the file that you are creating.

.. image:: /_static/images/QGIS_save_as.png

Now if you check the size of the newly created ``brazil_compressed.geojson``, you should see that it is much smaller!

Run the command: ::

  $ ls -lh brazil_compressed.geojson


.. image:: /_static/images/CLI_check_compressed_file_size.png

.. note::

  A file size of 331K isn't great for a webapp; it's still a bit large. In a few weeks, we'll look at how some of the features of GeoServer allows you to display large amounts of data without a big download.

The last step is to join all of the GeoJSON files together. To do that, we can use a nice Node.js library from MapBox. Run the following commands: ::

  $ npm install -g @mapbox/geojson-merge
  $ geojson-merge argentina_compressed.geojson brazil_compressed.geojson columbia_compressed.geojson dominican_republic_compressed.geojson el_salvador_compressed.geojson equador_compressed.geojson guatamala_compressed.geojson haiti_compressed.geojson mexico_compressed.geojson
  nicaragua_compressed.geojson panama_compressed.geojson > states.geojson

To save you time, we went ahead and optimized the geometries for each country. Some might still need some work, but can
tackle that some day when you are bored.
